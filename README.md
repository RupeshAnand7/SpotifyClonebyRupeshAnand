Made using HTML, CSS and JS.
I actually wanted to create a dynamic music player using fetch api, but on Github Pages or Netlify, this feature was not working, so I have used Arrays, but on the local version which is on my pc, its dynamic, it loads albums and songs using fetch api.

Keyboard Shortcuts: -
left and right arrow - seek 5 seconds forward or backword
up an ddown arrow - to increase or decrease sound
m - to mute/unmute
space or k - to pause/play
alt + left arrow - previous song
alt + right arrow - next song
All the above functions can be performed by mouse click also.
Click on an album to start playing the first song of that album. 
The playlist button beside Spotify logo is for accessing playlist, you can toggle it to make playlist appear and disappear, playlist contains songs present in selected album. Click on any song in playlist and it plays.
When a song ends, provided that it was not the last song, then the next song of same playlist starts playing.
